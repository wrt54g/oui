## How oui works
oui is a list of OUIs (MAC Address vendors). It is all added without even looking at IEEE's list. The list is just a .txt file and the OUIs are seperated with spaces and enters.
## What we're missing
We currently don't have a lot of smartphone or computer vendors, but we do have a lot of the smart home and networking equipment vendors.
