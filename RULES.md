So, there is a missing OUI in here? Please let me know via Issues! But. please first read our rules.

Rule #1: Never request OUIs that you have only seen via IEEE's list. If we feel you have, we'll deny your request.
Rule #2: Open an ISSUE for it, not a pull request.
Rule #3: I cannot guarantee that I'll respond within 24 hours, but most of the times I do.
